To do so, we will predict the next value of the function in a loop, conditioning on the value at the previous time-step (be it the initial, given, values or the ones predicted by the network at each previous step).\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn the prediction model, we will use **teacher forcing**. This means that *during training* we will condition the model on values *coming from the ground truth* (i.e., the real sequence), rather than the output produced by the model at $t-1$. This makes training easier, because errors do not compound (a bad prediction at time $t$ does not influence the next prediction at time $t+1$).\n",
        "\n",
        "At *inference time* (i.e., when we want to generate data from the model) we do not have access to the true sequence, so we must condition on the values *predicted by the model in previous time-steps*. This often leads to some compounding error, which generally makes it harder and harder to generate long sequences accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "To alleviate this problem we will also experiment with **warm starting**, which amounts to feeding the model with values coming from the ground truth (as done when teacher forcing) *only for a few initial steps*, and then feed it with its previous predictions instead. The rationale for this is to make training easier initially, to help the model learn the true function, and then feed it with its predictions to become robust to imperfect data."

For instance, 'dog' and 'bone' will appear more often in documents about dogs, while 'cat' and 'meow' will appear in documents about cats. Common words, like 'the' and 'is', will tend to appear approximately uniformely in all kinds of documents so are not very informative to tell the documents apart.
